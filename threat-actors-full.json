APT5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries, but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies, especially information about satellite communications. \nAPT5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications.

The group has been active since 2017 and has been tracked under UNC902 and later on as TEMP.Warlok. In some ways, FIN11 is reminiscent of APT1; they are notable not for their sophistication, but for their sheer volume of activity.(FireEye) Mandiant has also responded to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we’ve only observed the group successfully monetize access in few instances. This could suggest that the actors cast a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group’s shifting monetization methods—from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion. Notably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen, but we do not attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is complicated by the actors’ use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated actors, FIN11 doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely enables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their operations.","meta":{"refs":["https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong.html","https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/fin11-email-campaigns-precursor-for-ransomware-data-theft.html","https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/7451/447347"],"synonyms":["TEMP.Warlock","UNC902"]},"related":[{"dest-uuid":"b27dcdee-14b1-5842-86b3-32eacec94584","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"}],"value":"FIN11"},"vendors_and_products_targeted":[{"vendor":"Fortra","product":"GoAnywhere MFT"},{"vendor":"Progress","product":"MOVEit Transfer"},{"vendor":"SolarWinds","product":"Serv-U"},{"vendor":"Accellion","product":"FTA"},{"vendor":"PaperCut","product":"MF/NG"},{"vendor":"PaperCut","product":"papercut_mf"},{"vendor":"F5","product":"BIG-IP"},{"vendor":"Apache","product":"Log4j2"},{"vendor":"Barracuda Networks","product":"Email Security Gateway (ESG) Appliance"},{"vendor":"CrushFTP","product":"CrushFTP"},{"vendor":"Cleo","product":"Multiple Products"},{"vendor":"SysAid","product":"SysAid Server"}],"associated_mitre_attack_techniques":[{"id":"T1190","name":"Exploit Public-Facing Application","domain":"Enterprise","tactics":["initial-access"],"subtechnique":false},{"id":"T1210","name":"Exploitation of Remote Services","domain":"Enterprise","tactics":["lateral-movement"],"subtechnique":false}]},{"threat_actor_name":"FIN13","date_added":"2021-01-05","mitre_id":"G1016","misp_id":"60fa684d-c738-4b77-98fb-3f6605e2bb82","malpedia_url":"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/fin13","vendor_names_for_threat_actors":[{"vendor_name":"Mandiant","threat_actor_name":"FIN13"}],"cve_references":[{"url":"https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/8776530/Sygnia-%20Elephant%20Beetle_Jan2022.pdf","date_added":"2021-01-05","cve":["CVE-2001-0507","CVE-2010-5326","CVE-2015-7450","CVE-2017-1000486"]},{"url":"https://www.netwitness.com/wp-content/uploads/FIN13-Elephant-Beetle-NetWitness.pdf","date_added":"2022-08-01","cve":["CVE-2019-2729","CVE-2021-44228","CVE-2019-0604"]}],"misp_threat_actor":{"description":"Since 2017, Mandiant has been tracking FIN13, an industrious and versatile financially motivated threat actor conducting long-term intrusions in Mexico with an activity timeframe stretching back as early as 2016.

In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted INDRIK SPIDER millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware.\nIn August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by INDRIK SPIDER, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.","meta":{"country":"RU","refs":["https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-the-evolution-of-indrik-spider-from-dridex-wire-fraud-to-bitpaymer-targeted-ransomware/"],"synonyms":["Manatee Tempest"]},"related":[{"dest-uuid":"b19bc1a0-2489-56ae-aa61-ed147310363e","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"},{"dest-uuid":"3ce9610b-2435-4c41-80d1-3f95a5ff2984","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"}],"value":"INDRIK SPIDER"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0119","aliases":["Indrik Spider","Evil Corp","Manatee Tempest","DEV-0243","UNC2165"],"description":"[Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119) is a Russia-based cybercriminal group that has been active since at least 2014.

in the Cloud documents a complex ecosystem of cyber espionage that systematically compromised government, business, academic, and other computer network systems in India, the Offices of the Dalai Lama, the United Nations, and several other countries. The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third-party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows’ attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing systems, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

This adversary consistently leverages spear phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents, malware designed to target the Android mobile platform, and phishing activity designed to harvest user credentials. In March 2017, the 360 Chasing Team found a sample of targeted attacks that confirmed the previously unknown sample of APT's attack actions, which the organization can now trace back at least in April 2016.

Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access.\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent.

Technical analysis on some of the attacks as well as attribution links with Pakistan actors have been already depicted by 360 and Tuisec, in which they found interesting connections to a larger group of attackers Unit 42 researchers have been tracking, which we are calling Gorgon Group.","meta":{"refs":["https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-gorgon-group-slithering-nation-state-cybercrime/","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-tracking-subaat-targeted-phishing-attacks-point-leader-threat-actors-repository/","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/aggah-campaign-bit-ly-blogspot-and-pastebin-used-for-c2-in-large-scale-campaign/","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0078/","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/pastygemini/"],"synonyms":["Gorgon Group","Subaat","ATK92","G0078","Pasty Gemini"]},"value":"The Gorgon Group"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0078","aliases":["Gorgon Group"],"description":"[Gorgon Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0078) is a threat group consisting of members who are suspected to be Pakistan-based or have other connections to Pakistan.

The company has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments – an allegation it has consistently denied.\nWhen the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB of internal data – including the once-secret list of customers, internal communications, and spyware source code – leaked online, Hacking Team was forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an uncertain future.\nFollowing the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the company’s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking Team’s resumed operations came six months later – a new sample of Hacking Team’s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild. A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking Team’s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team’s shareholding. Tablem Limited is officially based in Cyprus; however, recent news suggests it has ties to Saudi Arabia.","meta":{"refs":["https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/03/09/new-traces-hacking-team-wild/","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team","https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gvye3m/spy-tech-company-hacking-team-gets-hacked"]},"value":"Hacking Team"},"country":"IT","vendors_and_products_targeted":[{"vendor":"Adobe","product":"Flash Player"},{"vendor":"Linux","product":"Kernel"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"ATM Font Driver"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Internet Explorer"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Windows"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Silverlight"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Office"},{"vendor":"Oracle","product":"jdk"}]},{"threat_actor_name":"HookAds","date_added":"2018-11-13","misp_id":"dce617eb-a3b6-4a9a-bd76-575c424f9761","malpedia_url":"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/hookads","cve_references":[{"url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hookads-malvertising-installing-malware-via-the-fallout-exploit-kit/","date_added":"2018-11-13","cve":["CVE-2018-8174"]}],"misp_threat_actor":{"description":"HookAds is a malvertising campaign that purchases cheap ad space on low quality ad networks commonly used by adult web sites, online games, or blackhat seo sites.

Beginning in early 2019, these threat actors targeted a number of government agencies in East Asia overseeing government information technology, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, economic development, and political processes. We determined that the infection vector observed in this campaign was spear phishing, with emails originating from both free email accounts and compromised user accounts. Attackers relied on Microsoft Equation Editor exploit CVE-2018-0798 to deliver a custom malware that Proofpoint researchers have dubbed Cotx RAT. Additionally, this APT group utilizes Poison Ivy payloads that share overlapping command and control (C\u0026C) infrastructure with the newly identified Cotx campaigns. Based on infrastructure overlaps, post-exploitation techniques, and historic TTPs utilized in this operation, Proofpoint analysts attribute this activity to the Chinese APT group tracked internally as TA428.

Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C\u0026C servers and email addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments. One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control.\nAs part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate document but executes a malicious payload in the background.\nWe were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor attackers’ activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised honeypot. The attackers issued out some basic commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.","meta":{"refs":["https://www.trendmicro.de/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_the_taidoor_campaign.pdf","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0015/","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/j/tracking-earth-aughiskys-malware-and-changes.html","https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/taidoor-a-truly-persistent-threat"],"synonyms":["G0015","Earth Aughisky"]},"value":"Taidoor"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0015","aliases":["Taidoor"],"description":"[Taidoor](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0015) has been deprecated, as the only technique it was linked to was deprecated in ATT\u0026CK v7.","references":[{"source_name":"mitre-attack","url":"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0015","external_id":"G0015"}]},"country":"CN","vendors_and_products_targeted":[{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Excel"},{"vendor":"Adobe","product":"Acrobat and Reader"},{"vendor":"Adobe","product":"Flash Player"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Office"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"MSCOMCTL.OCX"},{"vendor":"Microsoft","product":"Word"}]},{"threat_actor_name":"TeamTNT","date_added":"2022-08-25","mitre_id":"G0139","misp_id":"27de6a09-844b-4dcb-9ff9-7292aad826ba","malpedia_url":"https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/teamtnt","cve_references":[{"url":"https://www.cloudsek.com/threatintelligence/timeline-ttps-of-teamtnt-cybercrime-group","date_added":"2022-08-25","cve":["CVE-2019-5736"]}],"misp_threat_actor":{"description":"In early Febuary, 2021 TeamTNT launched a new campaign against Docker and Kubernetes environments.

The attackers use very simple malware, which required little development time or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web hosting, to implement a highly effective attack. It is a case of the attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they are after. The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the victim. A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates the malware. The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP).\nThe vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other cases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.ænThe attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain.

We call this activity group RASPITE.  Analysis of RASPITE tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. RASPITE targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.  RASPITE leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. RASPITE uses the same methodology as DYMALLOY and ALLANITE in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to RASPITE-controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.","meta":{"refs":["https://dragos.com/blog/20180802Raspite.html","https://symantec-blogs.broadcom.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/leafminer-espionage-middle-east","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0077/"],"synonyms":["LeafMiner","Raspite"]},"value":"RASPITE"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0077","aliases":["Leafminer","Raspite"],"description":"[Leafminer](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0077) is an Iranian threat group that has targeted government organizations and business entities in the Middle East since at least early 2017.

The Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States;Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments;organizations associated with Chechen extremism;and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large - scale spear - phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash - and - grab approach involving a fast but noisy breakin followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible.If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long - term intelligence gathering. This threat actor targets government ministries and agencies in the West, Central Asia, East Africa, and the Middle East; Chechen extremist groups; Russian organized crime; and think tanks. It is suspected to be behind the 2015 compromise of unclassified networks at the White House, Department of State, Pentagon, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The threat actor includes all of the Dukes tool sets, including MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, SeaDuke, CloudDuke (aka MiniDionis), and HammerDuke (aka Hammertoss).

Based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their C\u0026C servers, BlackTech’s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target’s technology.\nFollowing their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of fate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns: PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and of late, Waterbear.\nPLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents. Active since 2012, it has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations. PLEAD’s toolset includes the self-named PLEAD backdoor and the DRIGO exfiltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing emails to deliver and install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage services. Some of the cloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are also used as drop off points for exfiltrated documents stolen by DRIGO.\nPLEAD actors use a router scanner tool to scan for vulnerable routers, after which the attackers will enable the router’s VPN feature then register a machine as virtual server. This virtual server will be used either as a C\u0026C server or an HTTP server that delivers PLEAD malware to their targets.","meta":{"country":"CN","refs":["https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns/","https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/07/09/certificates-stolen-taiwanese-tech-companies-plead-malware-campaign/","https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/14/plead-malware-mitm-asus-webstorage/","https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf","https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/cb19-cyber-threat-landscape-in-japan-revealing-threat-in-the-shadow-by-chi-en-shen-ashley-oleg-bondarenko","https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/palmerworm-blacktech-espionage-apt","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/mangataurus/","https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/cyber-year-in-retrospect/yir-cyber-threats-report-download.pdf","https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/d/earth-hundun-waterbear-deuterbear.html","https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2022/03/jsac2022report1.html"],"synonyms":["CIRCUIT PANDA","Temp.Overboard","HUAPI","Palmerworm","G0098","T-APT-03","Manga Taurus","Red Djinn","Earth Hundun","Canary Typhoon"]},"value":"BlackTech"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0098","aliases":["BlackTech","Palmerworm"],"description":"[BlackTech](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0098) is a suspected Chinese cyber espionage group that has primarily targeted organizations in East Asia--particularly Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong--and the US since at least 2013.

The group has been active since at least 2009 and was reportedly responsible for the November 2014 destructive wiper attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment as part of a campaign named Operation Blockbuster by Novetta. Malware used by Lazarus Group correlates to other reported campaigns, including Operation Flame, Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, DarkSeoul, and Ten Days of Rain.  In late 2017, Lazarus Group used KillDisk, a disk-wiping tool, in an attack against an online casino based in Central America. \n\nNorth Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and the name Lazarus Group is known to encompass a broad range of activity. Some organizations use the name Lazarus Group to refer to any activity attributed to North Korea. Some organizations track North Korean clusters or groups such as Bluenoroff, APT37, and APT38 separately, while other organizations may track some activity associated with those group names by the name Lazarus Group.","techniques":[{"technique_id":"T1001","technique_name":"Data Obfuscation","sub_technique":"003","sub_technique_name":"Protocol

Further analysis revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX.\nRecently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from MUSTANG PANDA, using a unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly observed activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems. Additionally, MUSTANG PANDA actors reused previously-observed legitimate domains to host files.","meta":{"attribution-confidence":"50","cfr-suspected-state-sponsor":"China","cfr-suspected-victims":["United States","Germany"],"cfr-target-category":["Civil society"],"cfr-type-of-incident":["Espionage"],"country":"CN","refs":["https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations/mustang-panda","https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/","https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2020CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport.pdf","https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-president","https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/chinese-apt-bronze-president-spy-campaign-russian-military","https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/assets/cyber-threats-2019-retrospect.pdf","https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf","https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_fog_of_war_research_report.pdf","https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/k/earth-preta-spear-phishing-governments-worldwide.html","https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta416-goes-ground-and-returns-golang-plugx-malware-loader","https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-targets-philippines-government-cyberespionage/","https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Cyber-Sicherheitslage/Analysen-und-Prognosen/Threat-Intelligence/Aktive_APT-Gruppen/aktive-apt-gruppen_node.html","https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW1aFyW","https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2023/pdf/JSAC2023_2_LT4.pdf","https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/microsoft-threat-intelligence/4/notes"],"synonyms":["BRONZE PRESIDENT","HoneyMyte","Red Lich","TEMP.HEX","BASIN","Earth Preta","TA416","Stately Taurus","LuminousMoth","Polaris","TANTALUM","Twill Typhoon"]},"value":"MUSTANG PANDA"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0129","aliases":["Mustang Panda","TA416","RedDelta","BRONZE PRESIDENT"],"description":"[Mustang Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129) is a China-based cyber espionage threat actor that was first observed in 2017 but may have been conducting operations since at least 2014.

primarily in the Middle East by targeting organizations in this region that are in a variety of different industries; however, this group has occasionally targeted organizations outside of the Middle East as well. It also appears OilRig carries out supply chain attacks, where the threat group leverages the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets. \r\n\r\nOilRig is an active and organized threat group, which is evident based on their systematic targeting of specific organizations that appear to be carefully chosen for strategic purposes. Attacks attributed to this group primarily rely on social engineering to exploit the human rather than software vulnerabilities; however, on occasion this group has used recently patched vulnerabilities in the delivery phase of their attacks. The lack of software vulnerability exploitation does not necessarily suggest a lack of sophistication, as OilRig has shown maturity in other aspects of their operations. Such maturities involve:\r\n\r\n-Organized evasion testing used the during development of their tools.\r\n-Use of custom DNS Tunneling protocols for command and control (C2) and data exfiltration.\r\n-Custom web-shells and backdoors used to persistently access servers.\r\n\r\nOilRig relies on stolen account credentials for lateral movement. After OilRig gains access to a system, they use credential dumping tools, such as Mimikatz, to steal credentials to accounts logged into the compromised system. The group uses these credentials to access and to move laterally to other systems on the network. After obtaining credentials from a system, operators in this group prefer to use tools other than their backdoors to access the compromised systems, such as remote desktop and putty. OilRig also uses phishing sites to harvest credentials to individuals at targeted organizations to gain access to internet accessible resources, such as Outlook Web Access.\n\n\n\nSince at least 2014, an Iranian threat group tracked by FireEye as APT34 has conducted reconnaissance aligned with the strategic interests of Iran. The group conducts operations primarily in the Middle East, targeting financial, government, energy, chemical, telecommunications and other industries. Repeated targeting of Middle Eastern financial, energy and government organizations leads FireEye to assess that those sectors are a primary concern of APT34. The use of infrastructure tied to Iranian operations, timing and alignment with the national interests of Iran also lead FireEye to assess that APT34 acts on behalf of the Iranian government.","meta":{"attribution-confidence":"50","cfr-suspected-state-sponsor":"Iran (Islamic Republic of)","cfr-suspected-victims":["Israel","Kuwait","United States","Turkey","Saudi

blog post discusses the technical details of a state-sponsored attack manipulating DNS systems. While this incident is limited to targeting primarily national security organizations in the Middle East and North Africa, and we do not want to overstate the consequences of this specific campaign, we are concerned that the success of this operation will lead to actors more broadly attacking the global DNS system. DNS is a foundational technology supporting the Internet. Manipulating that system has the potential to undermine the trust users have on the internet. That trust and the stability of the DNS system as a whole drives the global economy. Responsible nations should avoid targeting this system, work together to establish an accepted global norm that this system and the organizations that control it are off-limits, and cooperate in pursuing those actors who act irresponsibly by targeting this system.","meta":{"cfr-suspected-victims":["Germany"],"country":"TR","refs":["https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/04/seaturtle.html","https://blog.talosintelligence.com/sea-turtle-keeps-on-swimming","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-hijack-exclusive/exclusive-hackers-acting-in-turkeys-interests-believed-to-be-behind-recent-cyberattacks-sources-idUSKBN1ZQ10X","https://icann.zoom.us/recording/play/AhQB4AQyjCuEJGz2wQQans0Xqkz3su8swGLQoORJhdECw9ttz0TbuyzBlue85gIY","https://community.icann.org/download/attachments/109483867/Cybersecurity%20and%20the%20ICANN%20Ecosystem.pdf","https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/assets/cyber-threats-2019-retrospect.pdf","https://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/pwc-cyber-threats-2020-a-year-in-retrospect.pdf","https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/finding-additional-indicators-with-passive-dns-within-domaintools-iris","https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/Report2022GTR.pdf","https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi?id=101738","https://threatintel.eu/2020/02/25/on-sea-turtle-campaign-targeting-greek-governmental-organisations-timeline","https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale","https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/magazine/2019/VB2019-Mercer-Rascagneres.pdf","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws1k44ZhJ3g","https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Cyber-Sicherheitslage/Analysen-und-Prognosen/Threat-Intelligence/Aktive_APT-Gruppen/aktive-apt-gruppen_node.html"],"synonyms":["COSMIC WOLF","Marbled Dust","SILICON","Teal Kurma","UNC1326"]},"related":[{"dest-uuid":"fc91881e-92c0-5a63-a0b9-b253958a594e","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"}],"value":"Sea Turtle"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G1041","aliases":["Sea Turtle","Teal Kurma","Marbled Dust","Cosmic Wolf","SILICON"],"description":"[Sea Turtle](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1041) is a Türkiye-linked threat actor active since at least 2017 performing espionage and service provider compromise operations against victims in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Turla hackers, initial intelligence had indicated western powers were key targets, but it was later determined embassies for Eastern Bloc nations were of more interest. Embassies in Belgium, Ukraine, China, Jordan, Greece, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Poland, and Germany were all attacked, though researchers from Kaspersky Lab and Symantec could not confirm which countries were the true targets. In one case from May 2012, the office of the prime minister of a former Soviet Union member country was infected, leading to 60 further computers being affected, Symantec researchers said. There were some other victims, including the ministry for health of a Western European country, the ministry for education of a Central American country, a state electricity provider in the Middle East and a medical organisation in the US, according to Symantec. It is believed the group was also responsible for a much - documented 2008 attack on the US Central Command. The attackers - who continue to operate - have ostensibly sought to carry out surveillance on targets and pilfer data, though their use of encryption across their networks has made it difficult to ascertain exactly what the hackers took.Kaspersky Lab, however, picked up a number of the attackers searches through their victims emails, which included terms such as Nato and EU energy dialogue Though attribution is difficult to substantiate, Russia has previously been suspected of carrying out the attacks and Symantecs Gavin O’ Gorman told the Guardian a number of the hackers appeared to be using Russian names and language in their notes for their malicious code. Cyrillic was also seen in use.'","meta":{"attribution-confidence":"50","cfr-suspected-state-sponsor":"Russian Federation","cfr-suspected-victims":["France","Romania","Kazakhstan","Poland","Tajikistan","Russia","United States","Saudi Arabia","Germany","India","Belarus","Netherlands","Iran","Uzbekistan","Iraq"],"cfr-target-category":["Government","Military"],"cfr-type-of-incident":["Espionage"],"country":"RU","refs":["https://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-25/","https://securelist.com/introducing-whitebear/81638/","https://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/","https://www.cfr.org/interactive/cyber-operations/turla","https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/technology/26cyber.html","https://securelist.com/blog/research/67962/the-penquin-turla-2/","https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/moonlight-maze-the-lessons/6713/","https://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-witchcoven.pdf","https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/65545/the-epic-turla-operation/","https://threatpost.com/linux-modules-connected-to-turla-apt-discovered/109765/","https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/","https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/","https://www.first.org/resources/papers/tbilisi2014/turla-operations_and_development.pdf","https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/russian_group_behind_2013_foreign_ministry_hack/8591548","https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/","https://securelist.com/blog/research/72081/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/","https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/november/turla-png-dropper-is-back/","https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/waterbug-attack-group","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/07/turla-hackers-spying-governments-researcher-kaspersky-symantec","https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/turla-outlook-backdoor-uses-clever-tactics-for-stealth-and-persistence/","https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/News/CaseStudies/study/115/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-PAC-A4-en-EN1.pdf","https://www.melani.admin.ch/melani/en/home/dokumentation/reports/technical-reports/technical-report_apt_case_ruag.html","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/","https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/07/russian-malware-hidden-britney-spears-instagram/","https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer.pdf","https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/vn/security/news/cyber-attacks/cyberespionage-group-turla-deploys-backdoor-ahead-of-g20-summit","https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-hacking-gang-just-updated-the-malware-it-uses-against-uk-targets/","https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/","https://www.telsy.com/turla-venomous-bear-updates-its-arsenal-newpass-appears-on-the-apt-threat-scene/","https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/iron-hunter","https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/","https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/continued-cyber-activity-in-eastern-europe-observed-by-tag","https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/fog-of-war-how-the-ukraine-conflict-transformed-the-cyber-threat-landscape/","https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_fog_of_war_research_report.pdf","https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Cyber-Sicherheitslage/Analysen-und-Prognosen/Threat-Intelligence/Aktive_APT-Gruppen/aktive-apt-gruppen_node.html","https://cip.gov.ua/services/cm/api/attachment/download?id=60068"],"synonyms":["Snake","VENOMOUS Bear","Group 88","Waterbug","WRAITH","Uroburos","Pfinet","TAG_0530","KRYPTON","Hippo Team","Pacifier APT","Popeye","SIG23","IRON HUNTER","MAKERSMARK","ATK13","G0010","ITG12","Blue Python","SUMMIT","UNC4210","Secret Blizzard","UAC-0144","UAC-0024","UAC-0003"]},"related":[{"dest-uuid":"7a19ecb1-3c65-4de3-a230-993516aed6a6","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"},{"dest-uuid":"c097471c-2405-4393-b6d7-afbcb5f0cd11","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"},{"dest-uuid":"8d19da8a-d0fa-5194-ad6f-315cc4f36c8b","tags":["estimative-language:likelihood-probability=\"likely\""],"type":"similar"}],"value":"Turla"},"mitre_group_cti":{"id":"G0010","aliases":["Turla","IRON HUNTER","Group 88","Waterbug","WhiteBear","Snake","Krypton","Venomous Bear","Secret Blizzard","BELUGASTURGEON"],"description":"[Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010) is a cyber espionage threat group that has been attributed to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

The group has targeted government, logistics, and shipping organizations. The threat actors gain initial access to targets using DNS hijacking, strategic web compromise with SMB forced authentication, and password brute force attacks. COBALT KATANA operates a custom platform referred to as the Sakabota Framework, also referred to as Sakabota Core, with a complimentary set of modular backdoors and accessory tools including Gon, Hisoka, Hisoka Netero, Killua, Diezen, and Eye. The group has implemented DNS tunnelling in its malware and malicious scripts and also operates the HyphenShell web shell to strengthen post-intrusion access. CTU researchers assess with moderate confidence that COBALT KATANA operates on behalf of Iran, and elements of its operations such as overlapping infrastructure, use of DNS hijacking, implementation of DNS-based C2 channels in malware and web shell security mechanisms suggest connections to COBALT GYPSY and COBALT

Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS) military unit 26165. This group has been active since at least 2004.          \n\nAPT28 reportedly compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016 in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.  In 2018, the US indicted five GRU Unit 26165 officers associated with APT28 for cyber operations (including close-access operations) conducted between 2014 and 2018 against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the US Anti-Doping Agency, a US nuclear facility, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Spiez Swiss Chemicals Laboratory, and other organizations. Some of these were conducted with the assistance of GRU Unit 74455, which is also referred to as Sandworm Team.
